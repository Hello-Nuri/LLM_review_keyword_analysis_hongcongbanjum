kakao_map,대흥역점,시간 날린거 생각하면 별 1개도 아까워요 주문 취소해서 배민에 리뷰도 못적어서 여기다 대신 남깁니다. 배달예정시간까지 한시간이나 기다려도 안와서 전화했더니 배달기사 배차가 안잡혀서 조리 시작도 안하고 있었다하네요?? 주문해놓고 기다리는 손님 시간을 전혀 신경쓰지않는 파렴치한 가게입니다. 오래걸릴것같으면 미리 전화줘야하는거아닌가요? 일단 주문했으니 몇시에 가져다줘도 먹겠지 한건가요?? 한시간 기다리게해놓고 배달기사탓하는거+조리 시작도 안한건 정말 책임감없는 행동이라 생각합니다. 동네 사는데 방문하고싶지도 않고 배달시키고싶지도않는 최악의 가게입니다.,2024-06-15,-1,"Thinking about the wasted time, even giving one star feels generous. I'm leaving this review here since I couldn't post it on the delivery app due to canceling my order. Even after waiting an hour past the expected delivery time, my food hadn't arrived, so I called the restaurant. They told me that they hadn't even started cooking because they couldn't find a delivery driver. A restaurant that doesn't care at all about its customers' time is absolutely disgraceful. Shouldn't they have called in advance if it was going to take this long? Did they think we'd eat it whenever it arrived just because we ordered? Blaming the delivery driver and not starting to cook for an hour is incredibly irresponsible. I live in the neighborhood, but I have no desire to visit or order from this place again. It's the worst restaurant I've encountered."
kakao_map,대흥역점,"짜장이 묽은 편이에요. 일반 짜장과 고기 짜장, 짬뽕밥 주문했는데 짜장은..흠..... 가격은 저렴하긴 하지만 나왔을때부터 짜장국에 면 말아 먹는 느낌",2024-07-28,-1,"The black bean sauce was quite watery. We ordered the regular black bean noodles, meat black bean noodles, and the spicy seafood soup with rice, but the black bean noodles... hmm... While the price is inexpensive, it felt like eating noodles soaked in black bean soup from the moment it was served."
kakao_map,대흥역점,고기짜장 먹었는데 고기는 다 짤리지도 않아서 다 뭉쳐 있고 짜장이 너무 달아서 맛없네요  홍콩반점 점바점이라더니 여기는 실패 입니다,2024-06-11,-1,"I tried the meat Jjajangmyeon, and the meat pieces were not properly cut and all clumped together. The sauce was too sweet and just didn't taste good. They say the quality varies by location for Hong Kong Banjeom, and this one was a disappointment."

kakao_map,대흥역점,방문해서 먹었는데 탕수육이 진짜 맛있네요 부드러우면서 쫄깃했어요,2024-08-04,1,"I visited and tried the sweet and sour pork, and it was really delicious. It was tender yet chewy."
