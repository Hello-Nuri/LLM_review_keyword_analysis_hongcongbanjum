네이버,홍대입구역점,더워죽겠어요 에어컨 한대는 꺼져있고 다른한대는 뜨거운바람나오고 먹다가 숨막혀쥭는줄 에어컨틀어달랫더니 고장낫다고 하네요 지하인데 환기도안되면서 에어컨 고장이 진짜 난건지 전기세아끼려고 하는건지 땀 줄줄,2024-06-11,-1,"It's unbearably hot in here. One air conditioner is off and the other one is blowing hot air. I thought I might suffocate while eating. When I asked them to turn on the air conditioner, they said it was broken. It's in the basement with no ventilation, so I can't tell if it's really broken or if they're just trying to save on electricity bills. I'm sweating buckets."
