네이버,관악난곡점,탕수육 포장해갔어요 주문하자마자 바로 해주고 맛있게 잘먹었습니다^^,2024-07-27,1,"I ordered sweet and sour pork for takeout. They prepared it right after I placed the order, and it was delicious."
네이버,관악난곡점,직원대응도 별로고 모든게 별로네요,2024-07-04,1,The staff's response was poor and everything else was just as bad.
네이버,관악난곡점,"백종원 대표가 홍콩반점 리뉴얼 한다고 유튜브 올려서 기대한 마음으로 방문함. 결론은 다른 지점보다 평균 이하로 맛이 떨어짐 (재방문의사X) 짬뽕에 홍합 없음. 이에 대한 사과나 안내가 없었고, 쿠팡에서 산 홍합이 끓여도 안벌어져서 안넣었다고 당당하게 말함 . 너무 심각한 맛과 서비스여서 본사에 컴플레인 건 상태 1. 매장이 배달때문에 많이 바쁘고 시끄러움 2. 알바생들은 바쁜 와중에 친절 하게 하려고 노력함 3. 짬뽕에 홍합 안넣은거에 대해 말했으나, 사과 및 안내 없이 너무 당당하게 안넣었다고 말함. 4. 실장이라고 하는 사람이 손이 느린지 주방에서 너무 음식이 늦게 나옴 5. 짜장면 - 소스 반만 넣어주고 너무 짬 6. 짬뽕 - 홍합은 없고, 국물에 기름이 많음 7. 탕수육 - 튀김옷 너무 두꺼움",2024-07-13,-1,"Baek Jong-won announced on YouTube that Hong Kong Banjom was being renewed, so I visited with high expectations. In conclusion, this branch's food quality is below average compared to others (no intention to revisit). The jjambbong didn't have any mussels. There was no apology or notice about this, and they openly said that the mussels they bought from Coupang didn't open even when boiled, so they didn't include them. The taste and service were so disappointing that I filed a complaint with the head office.

1. The restaurant was very busy and noisy due to delivery orders.
2. The part-time workers tried to be friendly despite being busy.
3. When I mentioned the missing mussels in the jjambbong, they confidently stated they didn't include them without any apology or notice.
4. The person in charge of the kitchen (manager) seemed slow, as food took a long time to be served.
5. Jjajangmyeon - Only half of the sauce was added, making it overly salty.
6. Jjambbong - No mussels, and the broth was too oily.
7. Tangsuyuk - The batter was too thick."
네이버,관악난곡점,"1.재료소진도아니고 ""바빠서""짜장밥이안된다고함 2.옆테이블다먹고가신거(사진첨부) 다먹을때까지안치워줌 우리테이블넘어왔던거 알아서치움...치워줄수있냐고했는데 대꾸도없음 3.탕짜셋트시켯는데 홀인원이 까먹음 4.어디는물갖다주고 어디는셀프고 정신없음 5.탕수육40분걸려서오는데 어디테이블인지도모름 장사접으세요그냥..",2024-06-30,-1,"1. They said they couldn't serve jajangbap because they were ""too busy"" even though they hadn't run out of ingredients.
2. The next table over had finished their meal (photo attached) and the plates weren't cleared until we moved them ourselves. We even asked if they could clear them, but got no response.
3. We ordered a tang-jja set, but they forgot the hole-in-one dish.
4. Some tables got their water served, while others were self-service. It was very disorganized.
5. Our tangsuyuk took 40 minutes to arrive, and they didn't even know which table it was for.

Just close down the restaurant..."
네이버,관악난곡점,프렌차이즈라서 믿고 먹어요!,2024-06-15,1,I trust this place because it's a franchise!
네이버,관악난곡점,맛있어요!^^,2024-07-04,1,Delicious!^^
네이버,관악난곡점,얼큰 짬뽕이 먹고싶어서 방문 했어요 맛있게 먹었습니다,2024-07-15,-1,I visited because I was craving spicy Jjamppong. I really enjoyed it.
네이버,관악난곡점,홍콩반점이 대대적으로 퀄리티 향상을 거쳤다는 소식에 주문 해 봤습니다! 짜장에 불맛도 강하고 짬뽕도 맛있어요~~ 탕수육도 바삭하니 맛있었습니다! 관악난곡점은 백 대표님 불시 점검에도 통과 하실 듯 해요~~ 배달은 여러집을 거쳐서 오는거 같더라구요 좀 오래 걸리긴 했습니다 (음식이 많이 식진 않았어요),2024-07-14,1,"I heard that the Hong Kong Banjum has significantly improved their quality, so I decided to place an order! The jjajang had a strong smoky flavor, and the jjamppong was delicious~~ The tangsuyuk was also crispy and tasty! The Gwanak Nanggok branch seems like it would pass Mr. Baek's surprise inspection~~ The delivery took a while because it seemed like it was making multiple stops (the food didn't get too cold though)."
kakao_map,관악난곡점,원래 별점 5개 주는 사람인데 여기 너무 시끄럽네요 직원들이.. 주방에선 노래부르고 홀직원 여자분은 목소리가 너무 커서 식사하는데 방해가 될 정도입니다.  수요일 7 반쯤이구요 사장님은 직원들한테 전달해주시면 되겠습니다. 짜장면은 살짝 탄맛이 나구요.  주방에서 홀까지 들리는건 문제가 있습니다.  침이 들어갈지 모르는 거고..,2024-07-19,-1,"I usually give 5-star ratings, but this place is just too noisy. The staff are too loud... In the kitchen, they're singing, and the female staff in the dining area speaks so loudly that it disrupts the meal. This was around 7:30 on a Wednesday. I hope the owner can address this with the staff. The jjajangmyeon had a slightly burnt taste. It's an issue that you can hear everything from the kitchen in the dining area. Who knows if any spit might get into the food..."
