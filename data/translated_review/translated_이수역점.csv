네이버,이수역점,음식맛이 좋아요,2024-07-26,1,The food tastes great.
네이버,이수역점,여름메뉴 냉짬뽕 시원하고 맛있네요.,2024-07-19,1,The summer special cold jjambbong is refreshing and delicious.
네이버,이수역점,복음잠뽕 먹지마세요 고추가루가 아니고 간장으로 복아서 맛도없고 별로임 그냥 잠뽕을 다시 시킬라다 잠봉도 병신일거 같아서 걍 배만 채움 돈아깝다,2024-07-21,-1,"Don't order the Bokkeum Jjamppong. It's not made with chili powder but soaked in soy sauce, so it tastes bad and isn't worth it. I was thinking about ordering regular Jjamppong instead, but I figured it would be just as bad, so I just filled my stomach. It was a waste of money."
네이버,이수역점,포장해서 먹었는데 참 특별한 짜장면 같아요.이집만의 소금짜장면이 있나봐요^^정말 너무 짜서 면 다 버리고 저정도에 버린 면 양만큼 밥 비벼먹어도 좀 짯어요.정말 이번에 솔루션도 햇다는데 이 점은 안받앗나봐요. 진짜 정말 염분가득한 짜장면을 드시고 싶은 분께 여기 짜장면 추천합니다❤️,2024-07-25,-1,"I got the food to-go, and it was quite a unique experience with the jajangmyeon. It seems like this place has its own special ""salt jajangmyeon.""^^ It was so salty that I ended up tossing out the noodles, and even when I mixed the same amount of rice with the sauce, it was still too salty. They mentioned that they've recently made some improvements, but it seems this aspect was not addressed. If you're someone who really wants to try jajangmyeon loaded with salt, I recommend this place's jajangmyeon. ❤️"
네이버,이수역점,음..여기방금포장해서먹고 후기를남겨요 나와어머니점심으로... 결론은 두세번집어먹고 버렸습니다 어머니는 한입먹고 버렸습니다  너무너무짜요  그냥 소금덩어리일정도로..진짜  이거많이먹으면 건강위협할정도로짜더군요  어찌어찌먹자고했는데도  못먹고버렸습니다 여기 자영업자분한테죄송하지만이정도면장사를하지말기를권합니다 솔직히 사장님 먹어보기는한거예요?    백종원씨솔루션방송용쑈질인지몬지  모르겠지만  헛지거리했네요 최악이네요 짜장이이정도면 다른것은뻔하죠..,2024-08-11,-1,"Hmm.. I just picked up an order from here and ate it with my mother for lunch... In conclusion, after a couple of bites, we threw it away. My mother took one bite and also threw it out. It was extremely salty, almost like a block of salt... Honestly, eating too much of this could be a health hazard due to the excessive saltiness. We tried to eat it somehow, but we couldn't and ended up discarding it. I feel sorry for the business owner, but if it's this bad, I would advise not running a restaurant. Honestly, have you even tasted what you're serving? I don't know if you're doing some kind of show for Baek Jong-won's Solution or whatever, but it was a complete failure. It was the worst. If the black bean sauce noodles are this bad, I can only imagine how the other dishes are."
네이버,이수역점,잘은 모르지만 탕수육 고기가 소시지같은 느낌이,2024-07-28,-1,"I can't say for sure, but the meat in the tangsuyuk tasted kind of like sausage."
네이버,이수역점,자장면은 조금 짠 편이에요 옆테이블 손님고 짜다고 얘기하더라구요,2024-07-28,-1,The jajangmyeon is a bit on the salty side. I heard the customers at the neighboring table also mentioning it was salty.

네이버,이수역점,"계란 이쁘게 올려주시네 볶음밥이 아니라 안먹었는데, 계란 실허네 ㅋㅋ",2024-06-23,1,"They put the egg on top so nicely, but I didn't eat it because it's not fried rice. Still, the egg looks cute, haha."
네이버,이수역점,고추짜장 짜장밥 마싯슴 굳굳,2024-06-28,1,"The gochu jjajang (spicy black bean sauce) rice was delicious, really good!"

kakao_map,이수역점,장소가 좀 좁고 친절하진 않지만 이름값답게 무난한 맛.. 탕수육는 진짜 괜찮았음!! 짜장짬뽕은 무난.. 고추짜장도 추천,2024-07-18,1,"The place is a bit small and the service isn't the friendliest, but it lives up to its name with decent flavors. The sweet and sour pork was really good! The black bean noodles and spicy seafood noodle soup were alright. I also recommend the spicy black bean noodles.
