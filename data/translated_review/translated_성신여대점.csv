네이버,성신여대점,맛있어요,2024-06-15,1,It's delicious!
네이버,성신여대점,유튜브에 홍콩반점 점바점 악평이 많은데 여긴 맛있습니다. 대체로 대학가 주변 홍콩반점은 다 양호한듯,2024-07-13,1,"There are many negative reviews of Hong Kong Banjom on YouTube from various branches, but this place is delicious. Overall, it seems that Hong Kong Banjom locations near universities are generally pretty good."
네이버,성신여대점,짜장면 이 늦게 와서 아쉽죠,2024-06-23,-1,It's disappointing that the jjajangmyeon arrived late.
네이버,성신여대점,1. 탕수육 떨어졌는데 그냥 줍더니 감 2. 점심시간에 비쁜데 홀 알바 1명이내? 3. 나보다 늦게온 팀이 음식을 더 먼저받음 정확히 25분 걸림. 그리고 옆 테이블은 주문하고 5분만에 나옴 왜이렇게 차이나나요 음식 시간은 기다릴수있다 치는데 다른곳이 먼저 나오고 훨씬 빨리나오고 그런건 이해가 안되내요,2024-06-21,-1,"Here is the translation of the Korean restaurant review into natural English:

1. They dropped the sweet and sour pork, but just picked it up and served it.
2. It's busy during lunchtime, but there's only one part-time worker in the hall?
3. A team that came later than me got their food first; it took exactly 25 minutes for mine. And the table next to me got their food just 5 minutes after ordering. Why is there such a big difference? I can understand waiting for my food, but I can't understand why other tables get their orders so much faster."
네이버,성신여대점,무슨 중국집이 주문하고 20분이 지나도록 안나오다가 겨우 탕수육 조금이랑 짬뽕 하나 나오고 주문을 시키고 저희보다 늦게 주문을 한 테이블것까지 한꺼번에 다같이 나오는거 보고 어이가 없는데 쟁반짜장은 주문한 시간부터 25분뒤에나 겨우 나오네요 언제나오냐고 물어보러 가니까 아 이제 나온다고 한마디 하는데 어이가 없네요,2024-06-18,-1,"What kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't bring out the food even after 20 minutes since ordering? We finally got a small portion of tangsuyuk and one jjambbong, but then we saw that people who ordered after us were getting their food at the same time. It was ridiculous. Our jajangmyeon on a platter took 25 minutes to come out from the time we ordered. When we went to ask about it, all they said was, ""It's coming out now."" Absolutely unbelievable."
네이버,성신여대점,짜장면 좋아,2024-08-10,1,I like the Jjajangmyeon.
네이버,성신여대점,짬뽕은 보통요,2024-07-06,-1,The jjampong is average.
네이버,성신여대점,짬봉 은 보통요,2024-07-20,-1,The jjambong is just average.
네이버,성신여대점,식당안이 냄새나서 아쉅죠,2024-06-08,-1,It's unfortunate that the restaurant smells bad.
kakao_map,성신여대점,짜장밥 먹엇습니다 정말 맛잇엇어요 짜장소스도 계란지단도 짬뽕국물도 근데 딱 하나 너무 아쉬운게 밥이 너무 질어요. 거의 떡 되기 직전의 밥이더라구요.  쌀 물만 잘 맞추면 완벽한데 아쉽네요,2024-06-22,-1,"I had the Jjajangbap, and it was really delicious. The black bean sauce, egg garnish, and the Jjamppong soup were all great. However, there's just one thing that was disappointing: the rice was too mushy. It was almost like it was about to turn into a rice cake. If they could just get the water-to-rice ratio right, it would be perfect. Too bad."
kakao_map,성신여대점,기대 안 하고 갔는데 가봤던 홍콩반점 중에 젤 맛있었어요 전혀 불지 않은 야들야들한 짜장면 진짜 대-존맛,2024-08-13,1,"I went without high expectations, but it turned out to be the best Hong Kong Banjum I've ever been to. The jjajangmyeon was tender and didn't get soggy at all—absolutely delicious!"
kakao_map,성신여대점,백종원 유튜브 보고서 얼마나바뀌었나 가봤는데 확실히 이전에는 뭐 그냥저냥이네 했다면 이번엔 맛있네로 바뀌었어요 근처 짬뽕선수보다 훨 맛잇어졌고 앞으론 여기로 다닐려고요,2024-07-03,1,"I watched Baek Jong-won's YouTube video and decided to see how much the place has improved. Before, it was just so-so, but now it's definitely delicious. It's gotten much better than the nearby jjampong place, and from now on, I'll be coming here instead."
kakao_map,성신여대점,개꿀맛입니다…,2024-06-07,1,It's incredibly delicious...
