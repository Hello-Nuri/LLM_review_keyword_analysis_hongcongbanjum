네이버,구로디지털단지역점,다 불어터진 면..... 혼밥 손님도 드문드문있어서 그냥 먹었지만..... 진짜 말해야하나 고민하다 그냥 나옴..... 짜장이 입에넣으면 면이 뚝뚝 끊김.... 탕짜면 아까운 내돈 10500원..... 직원 아주머니는 진짜 친절..... 그래서 더 얘기할수가없었음.....,2024-08-02,-1,"Soggy noodles..... There were a few other people dining alone, so I just ate it..... I thought about complaining but just left instead..... The noodles in the black bean sauce kept breaking apart in my mouth.... My 10,500 won for the tangjjamyeon felt wasted..... The staff lady was really kind..... That’s why I couldn’t bring it up....."

네이버,구로디지털단지역점,"홍콩반점에 방문했다. 예전에 블랙데이 이벤트 이후로 처음 방문하였는데, 6월달도 행사하는지 제복입은 교도관, 군인, 경찰, 소방관에게 짜장면을 3900원으로 행사문구를 보았다. 나는 해당되지 않기에 패스하고 짜장밥으로 선택 바로 주문하였다. 짜장소스에 밥과 잘비벼서 먹고 국물로 짬뽕국물로 입가심하면 면은 아니지만 짬뽕과 짜장을 같이 먹는 느낌을 내볼수 있다ㅎ 그런걸 생각하고 주문한건 아니었지만.. 나름 실패하지 않는 조합이라 생각했다. 간편하게 짜장밥 쓱싹 다 먹으니 배불렀다. 굿",2024-06-05,-1,"I visited Hong Kong Banjeom. It was my first time going there since the Black Day event a while back. I noticed they were running a promotion in June where correctional officers, soldiers, police officers, and firefighters could get jajangmyeon for 3,900 won. It didn't apply to me, so I skipped it and ordered the jajangbap instead. I mixed the rice well with the jajang sauce, and paired it with some jjamppong broth for a refreshing finish. Even though it's not noodles, you can still get the feeling of eating both jjamppong and jajangmyeon together. That's not why I ordered it, but I thought it was a pretty good combination that doesn't disappoint. After finishing my meal, I felt quite full. Good stuff!"
네이버,구로디지털단지역점,친절하시고 좋습니다 ㅎㅎ,2024-06-21,1,"The staff is friendly and nice, haha."
네이버,구로디지털단지역점,음식들 맛있고 양도 풍족하네요. 배달되지만 매장에서 먹는것이 더 양이 많은것 같네요. 주차도 편하며 제복입으신 분들에게 할인 행사도 하네요,2024-06-15,1,"The food is delicious and the portions are generous. They do offer delivery, but it seems like you get more food when you eat at the restaurant. Parking is convenient, and they also have a discount promotion for people in uniform."
kakao_map,구로디지털단지역점,구디역이 유동인구가 워낙 많다보니 그런건지....   뜨내기 상대 장사 치고도 상태가 많이 심각함,2024-07-23,-1,"Considering how many people pass through Goody Station, maybe that's why... But even for a place that caters to transient customers, the condition is quite serious."
kakao_map,구로디지털단지역점,맛이 정말 형편없음. 문제 개 많음. 중식 기본도 모르는듯.,2024-06-12,-1,The food was really terrible. There were so many problems. It seems like they don't even know the basics of Chinese cuisine.

kakao_map,구로디지털단지역점,짬뽕 시켰는데 엄청 맛있지는 않음. 국물이 진짜.. 최근 먹어본 사당역 진짜 맛났는데  이거 먹고 실망 그치만.. 먹을 만하지만 그냥 평범한 짬뽕..? 평범?? 요즘 짬뽕 잘하는곳이 없어져서 하... 홍콩반점 맛이 아님.,2024-06-11,-1,"I ordered the jjambbong, and it wasn't extremely delicious. The broth... I recently had a really good one near Sadang Station, and this was disappointing in comparison. Still, it's edible but just an average jjambbong. Average?? It's hard to find places that make good jjambbong these days... This doesn't taste like Hong Kong Banjum's jjambbong."
kakao_map,구로디지털단지역점,짜장 또는 고기 짜장에   꽃빵+꿀?  하면 개 맛잇엇음. 거기다 양파에 춘장 크아 짱 존맛이엿음,2024-06-04,1,"If you pair jjajang or meat jjajang with flower buns and honey, it tastes absolutely amazing. And dipping onions in chunjang sauce? Wow, it was unbelievably delicious!"
kakao_map,구로디지털단지역점,,2024-06-04,-1,"Whale Island is an incredible seafood restaurant in the heart of Seoul's bustling Jung-gu district. We had dinner here last Friday, and I must say, it exceeded all our expectations. The ambiance is both cozy and sophisticated, with tasteful maritime decor that sets the perfect mood for an unforgettable dining experience.

We started with the seafood platter, which was an impressive array of fresh oysters, clams, shrimp, and crab. Each item was more delectable than the last, and the presentation was simply stunning. For the main course, we opted for the grilled octopus and the seafood pasta. The octopus was cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful, while the seafood pasta was a harmonious blend of rich, savory sauce and perfectly cooked pasta with generous portions of mussels, shrimp, and squid.

The service was top-notch; our waiter was attentive without being intrusive, and he had excellent recommendations for both food and wine. We followed his suggestion and tried the house white wine, which paired beautifully with our meal.

To finish, we couldn't resist the dessert menu and ordered the tiramisu and lemon sorbet. The tiramisu was decadent without being overly sweet, and the lemon sorbet was the perfect palate cleanser to end the meal on a refreshing note.

Overall, Whale Island is a must-visit for anyone who loves seafood or just enjoys high-quality dining. We will definitely be returning soon to explore more of their exquisite menu."
