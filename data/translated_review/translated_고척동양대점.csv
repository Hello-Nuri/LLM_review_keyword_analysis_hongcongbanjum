네이버,고척동양대점,자장면 포장이요,2024-07-21,-1,"This review is quite brief and simply says, ""Jajangmyeon for takeout."""
네이버,고척동양대점,오랜만에  홍콩반점 냉짬뽕 먹어요ㅎㅎ 맛있어요ㅎ,2024-08-13,1,"I'm having cold jjamppong from Hong Kong Ban Jum for the first time in a while, hehe. It's delicious!"
네이버,고척동양대점,크 여름에는 역시 냉짬뽕 자주 먹게 되는 중독성 짱 맛도 짱입니다,2024-08-10,1,"In the summer, I can't resist cold jjamppong. It’s so addictive and the taste is amazing!"
네이버,고척동양대점,백종원 유튜브보고 한번 가봤는데 그게 영향이 있는지는 모르겠는데 맛은 전보다 괜찮아졌네요 같이 나온 짬뽕국물도 해물이 많이 들어간걸로보아 신경쓰는거 같습니다 근데 아쉬운게 짬뽕국물이 뜨거워야하는데 너무 미지근하네요 조금만 신경쓰면되는부분같은데요,2024-06-22,-1,"I decided to visit the restaurant after watching Baek Jong-won's YouTube video. I don't know if his influence had any effect, but the food tasted better than before. The jjambbong soup that came with the meal seemed to have a lot of seafood in it, which shows they’re putting in some effort. However, it was disappointing that the jjambbong soup wasn't hot enough; it was lukewarm. This seems like something they could easily fix with a bit more attention."
네이버,고척동양대점,느끼해요,2024-06-09,-1,It's greasy.
kakao_map,고척동양대점,면은 불어 쫄깃하지 않았음. 탕수육 맛있었음. 다만 내가 태어나서 다녀본 식당중 날파리가 제일 많았음. 심지어 잘먹어서 왕날파리였음. 할매들이 운영하는 국밥집보다 많았음. 댓글 삭제되면 벽에 날파리 30마리 정도 붙어있는 사진 첨부해 다시 올리겠음.,2024-08-07,-1,"The noodles were soggy and not chewy. The sweet and sour pork was delicious. However, this place had the most flies I've ever seen in a restaurant. The flies were so big and well-fed that they were practically kings. There were even more flies here than at those old grandma-run soup shops. If my comment gets deleted, I will repost it with a picture showing about 30 flies stuck to the wall."
kakao_map,고척동양대점,가성비 좋고 맛 괜찮고. 백종원 레시피 잘 지켜서 만드는듯. 다만 여름에 냉방이 좀 약해요.,2024-07-28,1,"Good value for money and decent taste. It seems like they follow Baek Jong-won's recipes well. However, the air conditioning is a bit weak in the summer."
