네이버,교대역점,연유꽃빵이 맛있어요.,2024-07-26,1,The condensed milk flower bread is delicious.
네이버,교대역점,다신 안올듯. 주문한지 30초만에 나온 짜장면은 면이 다 불어서 퍼져있음. 바쁘지않은 시간대였는데 면을 미리 삶아놓나봄. 그리고 메뉴판에있는 메뉴와 가게 진짜메뉴와 구성이 다름. 탕짜면 이런거없음,2024-08-04,-1,"I don't think I'll be coming back. The jajangmyeon I ordered came out in just 30 seconds and the noodles were all mushy and overcooked. It wasn't even a busy time, so maybe they pre-cook the noodles. Also, the actual menu at the restaurant differs from what's on the menu board. Items like ""Tangjjamyeon"" are not available."
네이버,교대역점,괜찮아요,2024-07-07,1,It's okay.
네이버,교대역점,좀 불친절함..,2024-06-28,-1,The service was a bit unfriendly..
네이버,교대역점,고추짜장에 군만두 굳!!,2024-07-23,1,The spicy black bean noodles and fried dumplings were amazing!!
네이버,교대역점,"겁나 불친절한 곳. 주인이 바뀌었는 지, 그 전에 계시던 사장님은 안 그랬는 데, 30대로 보이는 2명의 직원분이 아주아주 불친절하게 말을 하고, 라스트오더까지 시간이 10분이나 남았음에도 키오스크를 꺼버리고 주문을 안 받는다고 한다. 기분이 정말 더러웠음. 그리고, 짜장 양파는 볶다 말아서인지, 한참 뒤에 찍었어도 원래의 모습 그대로, 허옇게 살아있고, 탕수육은 오버쿡 되어서 겁나 딱딱해서, 입 천장이 다 까졌음. 홍콩반점, 백종원 대표 명성이나 이용해 먹으려는 빈대 심성의 작자들이 많이져서 단체로 욕먹고 있는 중으로 보인다. 교대점, 이젠 두번 다시 안 간다. 퉤퉤!",2024-07-13,-1,"The staff here are unbelievably rude. Maybe the owner changed, because the previous owner wasn't like this at all. Two employees who seem to be in their thirties spoke very, very rudely, and even though there were still 10 minutes left until last order, they turned off the kiosk and refused to take my order. It made me really upset. Plus, the onions in the jajangmyeon seemed only half-cooked; they were still as white and raw as if they had just been cut, even after sitting for a while. The sweet and sour pork (tangsu-yuk) was overcooked, so hard that the roof of my mouth got scratched up. It seems like a bunch of people here are just trying to exploit Hong Kong Banjom's reputation and Baek Jong Won's name for profit, and now they're collectively getting a bad reputation. I will never go to the Gyodae branch again. Disgusting!"
네이버,교대역점,짜장밥은계란옷이포슬하니맛있었음.소스도. 탕수육은맛이없었음. 일단고기를너무튀겼는지.딱딱했고.튀김옷도별로. 짜장밥에나오는짬뽕국물맛없음.,2024-07-09,-1,"The jajangbap with its fluffy egg coating was delicious, and the sauce was good too. However, the tangsuyuk was disappointing. The meat seemed over-fried and was too tough, and the batter wasn't great either. The jjampong broth that came with the jajangbap was also not tasty."
네이버,교대역점,"이게 홍반 정석이지… 교대역점 칭찬합니다👍 차타고 교대역점 오려면 주차는 무궁화 공영주차장 해야함. 진짜 면발 퉁퉁불고 소스완전 하루종일 조린거에 멘보샤 덜익히고, 짜장밥 소스랑 짬뽕국물은 소태에 음식물쓰레기 먹기 싫으면 서초역점 가지말고 교대역점 오길..(서초점 뻔뻔하게 백종원 내꺼내먹 나온거보면 소름끼치네) 진짜 교대역점 사장님 시간되면 서초역점 교육좀 해주세요. 같은 홍반 이름걸고 정말 음식물쓰레기 주는 곳 보면 마음 아픕니다. 서초역점에서 음식물쓰레기 대접받고 열받아서 교대역점도 안올까 하다가 혹시 몰라 왔는데 후회없이 잘 먹었네요. 서초역점에 갔다가 홍반 절대 안가시는 분들 오해말고 교대역점 와보시길 추천합니다~~",2024-06-14,1,"This is the quintessential Hongban experience... Kudos to the Gyodae Station branch 👍 If you're driving to the Gyodae Station branch, you'll need to park at the Mugunghwa public parking lot. The noodles were perfectly cooked, with the sauce simmered all day, and the menbosha was just right. If you don't want to eat what tastes like brine with food waste, skip the Seocho Station branch and come to the Gyodae Station branch instead. (Seeing the Seocho branch featured on Baek Jong Won's show is just chilling.) Gyodae Station branch owner, if you have the time, please consider training the Seocho Station staff. It's heartbreaking to see a place serving what tastes like food waste under the same Hongban name. I was so furious after being served trash at the Seocho Station branch that I almost didn't come to the Gyodae Station branch, but I'm glad I did—it was worth it. For those who have sworn off Hongban after a bad experience at the Seocho Station branch, I highly recommend giving the Gyodae Station branch a try!"
