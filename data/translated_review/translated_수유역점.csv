네이버,수유역점,맛있게 잘 먹었습니다,2024-07-06,1,I enjoyed the meal very much.
네이버,수유역점,"체인점이기 때문에 기본 이상은 하지않을까 생각하고 처음 방문해봤는데 완전 별로네요. 보통 공복이면 뭐든 다 맛있을텐데 여긴 물이 제일 맛있네요. 새컵에는 립스틱자국이 그대로 있고, 자장면,짬뽕,탕수육시켰는데 자장면,짬뽕은 하나같이 짜고 탕수육은 떡같이 붙어서 떼어지지도 않고 소스는 시큼하네요. 무엇보다도 공장식으로 바쁜건 알겠는데 음식에 머리카락이 두개나 나와서 여러번 불러도 보지도 않고, 환불하실지 음식 다시받을지 묻는 대처방식도 별로였어요.  진정성있는 사과도 없으시고  맛은 물론 서비스도 다 필요없고 오로지 음식만 많이 팔면 되는곳 같아서 다시는 가고싶지않습니다.  일부로 환불 안하고 리뷰쓴겁니다.",2024-08-04,-1,"Since it’s a chain restaurant, I thought it would at least meet basic standards, so I visited for the first time, but it was a complete letdown. Usually, anything tastes good when you're hungry, but here, the water was the most delicious thing. There was even a lipstick stain on my new cup. I ordered jjajangmyeon, jjampong, and tangsuyuk, but the jjajangmyeon and jjampong were both extremely salty, and the tangsuyuk was stuck together like a block, couldn’t be pulled apart, and the sauce was sour. Above all, I understand that it's busy like a factory, but finding two hairs in the food was unacceptable. Despite calling them several times, they didn’t even bother to look. Their way of handling the situation, asking if I wanted a refund or replacement, was poor. There was no sincere apology at all. It seemed like they only cared about selling as much food as possible, without any regard for taste or service, so I never want to go back. I purposely didn’t ask for a refund and wrote this review instead."
네이버,수유역점,여기 지점 생기고 처음 방문했습니다. 홍콩반점자체를 거의 일년만에 갔는데 짬뽕레시피가 달라졌나봐요. 물많이 넣고 캡사이신 넣은 국물맛에 이건 뭐지.. 예전 국물맛은 찾을수가 없어서 너무 안타까웠습니다.   탕수육도 조미료간이 너무 쎄져서 느끼함이 강해서 아쉬움이 많은 후기였습니다.,2024-06-24,-1,"I visited this location for the first time since it opened. It's been nearly a year since I last went to a Hong Kong Banjeom, and it seems like they changed the jjambbong recipe. The broth tasted like it had a lot of water and capsaicin added, which made me think, ""What is this...?"" I couldn't find the old, familiar taste of the broth, which was really disappointing. The sweet and sour pork was also heavily seasoned with MSG, making it taste too greasy. Overall, it was a somewhat disappointing experience."

네이버,수유역점,음식은 맛있습니다 데스크 알바녀가 내내 핸폰질만 하고 있습니다 손님은 손놈이라는 듯 아는체도 안해요 주방장이 불쌍한게 이 정도로 맛내는데도 알바녀가 분위기 망쳐서 손님들 다신 안오는걸 모를테니까요 하여간 근무 시간 내내 핸폰 붙잡고 있는 알바는 짤라야 한다고 봅니다 저런 인간 보기 시러 다시는 안갈듯해요,2024-07-04,-1,"The food is delicious, but the girl working at the front desk is on her phone the entire time. She acts as if customers are a bother and doesn't even acknowledge them. I feel bad for the chef because, despite the great food, the attitude of the staff ruins the atmosphere, and the customers probably won't come back. Honestly, employees who are glued to their phones during work hours should be let go. Seeing behavior like that makes me not want to return."
네이버,수유역점,홍콩반점 냉짬뽕맛집이였네🥹 진짜 내용물 실하고 시킴 음식 하이볼 다 너무 맛있었어요!! 재료도 푸짐하게 들어있고 고추짜장에 고추양보고 너무 놀랫습니다😂 맵찔이분들은 피해주세여.. 깐풍새우도 넘맛있고 좋았는데 가게내부에 하루살이?같은 벌레가 조금씩 날라다녀서 아쉬웠습니다ㅠ 또 음식을 직접 픽업하고 다 먹으면 퇴식대에 치워주셔야하니 참고하세용,2024-06-18,1,"Hong Kong Ban Jum is definitely the place for cold Jjambbong! 🥹 The food and the highballs we ordered were so delicious!! The ingredients were plentiful, and I was really surprised by the amount of peppers in the Spicy Jajangmyeon😂. If you can't handle spicy food, you might want to avoid it.. The spicy shrimp was also very tasty. However, it was a bit disappointing to see some small flies inside the restaurant. 😢 Also, keep in mind that you have to pick up your own food and clear your table when you're done."
kakao_map,수유역점,"여기저기 돌아다니면서 홍콩반점 자주감. 그런데 여기는 다른 홍콩반점과는 달리 음식 가져오고 치우고 하는게 셀프임. 그럼 그만큼 메리트가 있어야하는데 짬뽕곱배기 시켜보니 배추만 잔뜩 들어있고, 고기가 많거나 하지도 않음. 맛은 다른 지점과 비슷비슷함",2024-07-22,-1,"I often visit different Hong Kong Banjum locations. However, unlike other branches, this one requires customers to serve and clear their own food. Given that, there should be some merit to it, but when I ordered the large portion of jjambbong, it was filled mostly with cabbage and not much meat. The taste is pretty much the same as other locations."
